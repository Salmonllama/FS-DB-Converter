# FS-DB-Converter
A utility to convert the existing Fashionscape RethinkDB database to SQLite

It's not clean, it's not refined. It's not suited for general Rethink -> SQL
use, but it does what it's meant to do. It's meant to turn the 15,000 
Fashionscape outfits into SQL, and damn does it do that.
